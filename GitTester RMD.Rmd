```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This is a tester file to use some Github functions. Here is a chunk of code:
```{r}
library(gardenR)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable == "beans") %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarize(cum_weight=cumsum(weight), date) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=cum_weight))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(vars(variety), scales = "free")+
  labs(title= "Bean Varieties' Productivity", y = "Cumulative Weight (g)", x="")
  theme(legend.position= "none")
 
```
